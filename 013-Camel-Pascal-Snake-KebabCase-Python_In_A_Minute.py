## Naming Conventions

**Camel Case:**:

Camel case is a naming convention where each word in a variable name begins with a capital letter except for the first word.

Example: **camelCaseExample**

**Pascal Case:**

Pascal case is similar to camel case, but the first letter of every word in the variable name is capitalized.

Example: **PascalCaseExample**

**Snake Case:**

Snake case is a naming convention where words in a variable name are separated by underscores and all letters are lowercase.


Example: **snake_case_example**

**Kebab Case:**

Kebab case, also known as spinal case or dash case, is a naming convention where words in a variable name are separated by hyphens and all letters are lowercase.

Example: **kebab-case-example**
