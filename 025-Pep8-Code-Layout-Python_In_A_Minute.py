Description:
This script demonstrates Python code structuring and styling guidelines, focusing on class definitions, function definitions,
method organization inside classes, line length considerations, and line breaking techniques.

Best Practices Covered:
1. Surround method definitions inside classes with a single blank line.
2. Use blank lines sparingly inside functions to show clear steps.
3. Maximum line length and appropriate line breaking.

Usage:
- Run the script to understand and apply Python's recommended practices for code structure and styling.

# Python will assume line continuation if code is contained within parentheses, brackets, or braces:

from package import example1, \
    example2, example3

# If itâ€™s impossible to use implied continuation, then you can use backslashes (\) to break lines instead

total = (first_variable
         + second_variable
         - third_variable)

# total = (first_variable +
#          second_variable -
#          third_variable)

# If you need to break a line around binary operators, like + and *, then you should do so before the operator.
